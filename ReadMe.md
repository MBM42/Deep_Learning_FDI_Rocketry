## Simulations

### data_gen.py

Produces a CSV file where the faults are labelled with "1" and normal behavior with "0".

To use this script the current OS directory should be the "Simulations" folder. This way the script creates and saves the generated data in the corresponding folders.

## Models

To train any of models the current OS directory should be that of the corresponding model.


## Code Example

```
source myenv/bin/activate (myenv: virtual environment)
```

## Write Later

## Installation
```
pip install PyQt5
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Explain that plot_fault.py expects a certain profile of simulations
